Feature,BigLake Metastore (BLMS),BigQuery Tables for Apache Iceberg,Apache Iceberg Read-Only External Tables
Primary Nature,"A fully managed, serverless metastore that acts as a central catalog for open-format tables. It provides a single source of truth for metadata across multiple engines.","Fully managed tables within BigQuery that use the Iceberg format. BigQuery manages the underlying data files in a customer-owned Cloud Storage bucket.","Read-only pointers in BigQuery to existing, externally-managed Iceberg tables."
Management Model,"Serverless architecture, eliminating the need for cluster management. It is based on the BigQuery catalog for direct integration.","Fully managed by BigQuery. BigQuery handles automatic storage optimization, file sizing, garbage collection, and metadata. Modifying data files outside of BigQuery can lead to data loss or corruption.","Customer-managed. The user is responsible for managing the table and updating its metadata in BigQuery, especially when not using a central catalog like BLMS."
Read/Write from BigQuery,"BLMS itself doesn't perform read/write. It manages metadata. Tables cataloged in BLMS cannot be modified using BigQuery engine DML.","Full read and write access. Supports GoogleSQL DML (UPDATE, DELETE, MERGE) and high-throughput streaming via the Storage Write API.","Read-only. The tables cannot be modified using BigQuery DML."
Supported Engines,"Enables engine interoperability. Tables created and modified by engines like Apache Spark can be directly queried in BigQuery without extra configuration.","Primarily managed and written to by BigQuery. Other engines like Spark can read the data by exporting and referencing the Iceberg metadata snapshot.","Writable by any Iceberg-compatible engine (e.g., Spark, Flink). Readable from BigQuery."
Performance,"Query performance from the BigQuery engine might be slower compared to a standard BigQuery table and is generally equivalent to reading the data directly from Cloud Storage.","Offers performance benefits from automatic storage optimizations like adaptive file sizing and automatic clustering.","Performance depends on the underlying data layout. BigQuery supports manifest pruning to improve query speed on partitioned tables."
Security,"Leverages BigQuery's security model (column and row-level security) when tables are queried via BigQuery.","Supports column-level security and data masking.","Supports column-level security, row-level security, and data masking enforced by BigQuery."
Data Location,"Manages metadata pointing to data in Cloud Storage or other cloud providers.","Data is stored in a specified Cloud Storage bucket owned by the customer, but the files are managed by BigQuery.","Data can be in Cloud Storage, Amazon S3, or Azure Blob Storage."
Metadata Sync,"Provides a single source of truth. Changes made by one engine (like Spark) are automatically available to others (like BigQuery).","Metadata is managed by BigQuery. An EXPORT METADATA operation is needed to create a snapshot for external engines to read.","When using a JSON metadata file, the user must manually update the BigQuery table definition with the URI of the latest metadata file to reflect changes. Using BLMS is the recommended way to avoid this manual step."
